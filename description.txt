Marvel Universe for Terraria!
(Work in progress)

There are many plans and ideas for this mod but it will essentially bring some cool stuf from the Marvel Universe (specifically from the Marvel Cinematic Universe 'MCU') into terraria.

We plan on having:
- Weapons
- Armors
- NPCs
- Enemies
- Bosses
- New ores
- Infinity Saga Items

Developers: Nkaiw0rld, Lexnoss
Artist: Lexnoss

V0.2
This is a small but fun update. You will most likely not be able to use a character that already had this mod active so, we recommend creating a new one.

This version has:
6 permanent buffs
 - Chaos Vessel
 - Super Soldier
 - Secret Agent
 - Frenzied Mutant
 - Swift Mutant
 - Resilient Mutant
1 Weapon
3 Tools

New characters have a 1/3 chance to be mutants. The mutant type is also chosen randomly.
Chaos concoction can be crafted with Chaos Particles.
Super Soldier Serum has a 1/2 chance of dropping from twins.
Training Routine has a 1/2 chance of dropping from the destroyer.

---------------------------------------------------

V0.1
This is the very first version of the mod. Please don't risk any existing world/character as there may be bugs.
We encourage you to try Mjolnir and/or StormBreaker! (Huge thanks to GabeHasWon)

This version has:
6 weapons
2 armor sets
2 accesories
3 ores (2 with tiles)
2 consumables

New worlds will generate uranium.
The twins and the destroyer have a chance of 1/3 to drop Wakanda's Blessing. When consumed, it will bless the world with vibranium.
After defeating skeletron prime, enemies in hell will drop chaos particles.
Golem has a chance to drop Mjolnir, Duke Fishron drops stormbreaker, and Cultist drops Eye of Agamotto.
