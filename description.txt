Marvel Universe for Terraria!
(Work in progress)

There are many plans and ideas for this mod but it will essentially bring some cool stuf from the Marvel Universe (specifically from the Marvel Cinematic Universe 'MCU') into terraria.

We plan on having:
- Weapons
- Armors
- NPCs
- Enemies
- Bosses
- New ores
- Infinity Saga Items

Developers: Nkaiw0rld, Lexnoss

V0.1
This is the very first version of the mod. Please don't risk any existing world/character as there may be bugs.
We encourage you to try Mjolnir and/or StormBreaker! (Huge thanks to GabeHasWon)

This version has:
6 weapons
2 armor sets
2 accesories
3 ores (2 with tiles)
2 consumables

New worlds will generate uranium.
The twins and the destroyer have a chance of 1/3 to drop Wakanda's Blessing. When consumed, it will bless the world with vibranium.
After defeating skeletron prime, enemies in hell will drop chaos particles.
Golem has a chance to drop Mjolnir, Duke Fishron drops stormbreaker, and Cultist drops Eye of Agamotto.
